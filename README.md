About me

I am a Stage 2 Computer Science undergraduate at Newcastle University. 

In year 1 I got hooked on web development. On this page you will find some of my web dev work. Please note that most of these are my very early works and are not the best quality. 

During summer 2019 I participated in the iGEM competition with the Newcastle University team. As the web designer, I was tasked to design and construct the team wiki. Although it is not my proudest work (thanks to iGEMs' horrific wiki framework and tools), it was my first larger scale project that taught me many things about web development: responsive design, accessibility, project planning, and so on.

Currently, I have been on a web development hiatus since the start of year 2 of my degree. Though, I continue to apply my knowledge and skills as a design team leader / programmer / software tester in mobile development part of a software engineering project in my course.

I am currently looking for a placement year job.
